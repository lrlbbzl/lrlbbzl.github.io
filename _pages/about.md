<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Ruilin Luo. I am currently a master student (3rd year) in [Intelligent Interaction Group (IIGroup)](https://iigroup.github.io/), *Tsinghua University*, supervised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4gH3sxsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my bachelor's degree in *Huazhong University of Science and Technology*, supervised by Prof. [Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Prior to this, I spent three happy years of high school at *NO.1 Middle School Affiliated to Central China Normal University*.

My research interests lie in LLM/MLLM Reasoning and Graph Representation Learning.

**From Narrow to Panoramic Vision: Attention-Guided Cold-Start Reshapes Multimodal Reasoning**

`Ruilin Luo`\*, Chufan Shi\*, Yizhen Zhang\*, Cheng Yang, Songtao Jiang, Tongkun Guan, Ruizhe Chen, Ruihang Chu, Peng Wang, Mingkun Yang, Lei Wang, Yujiu Yang, Junyang Lin, Zhibo Yang

- We propose the VAS attention metric and find that the reasoning performance of Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRM) is highly correlated with VAS.
- We introduce the AVAR training pipeline, which enhances the effectiveness of multimodal reasoning data training by scaling VAS through three stages: data construction, cold-start initialization, and reinforcement learning.
- Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on reasoning and perception benchmarks at the 7B scale.

**Unlocking Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning via Process Reward Model**

`Ruilin Luo`, Zhuofan Zheng, Yifan Wang, Xinzhe Ni, Zicheng Lin, Songtao Jiang, Yiyao Yu, Chufan Shi, Ruihang Chu, Lei Wang, Jin zeng, Yujiu Yang

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04686) | [[Code]](https://github.com/URSA-MATH/URSA-MATH)
- We are the first to propose leveraging a process reward model (PRM) to provide process-level optimization in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
- We introduce a training framework addressing three key stages: reasoning data scarcity, reward data scaling, and online PRM-integrated reinforcement learning (RL).
- Our data is used to train [Seed1.5-VL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07062), and we open-source URSA-8B-PS-GRPO, a model whose reasoning capability matches that of the [InternVL3](https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal-reasoning/?m=REALTIME) series.

**PTD-SQL: Partitioning and Targeted Drilling with LLMs in Text-to-SQL**

`Ruilin Luo`, Liyuan Wang, Binghuai Lin, Zicheng Lin, Yujiu Yang

[[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.221/) | [[Code]](https://github.com/lrlbbzl/PTD-SQL)
- We propose a code agent framework for the text-to-SQL task that leverages structured grammars for question-type classification, followed by question-type-specific automated question bank construction and a two-layer few-shot retrieval mechanism.
- We observe that stronger models achieve greater improvements on harder question types when provided with better-matched few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts, reflecting a learning pattern aligned with human cognition.
- Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as Spider and BIRD.

**Fair Text-Attributed Graph Representation Learning**

`Ruilin Luo`, Tianle Gu, Lin Wang, Yunfeng Zhou, Lei Wang, Yujiu Yang

- We are the first to identify the bias amplification effect between language model embeddings and GNNs in TAG representation learning.
- We propose solutions from the perspectives of fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning.
- We provide a theoretical foundation for both the amplification of unfairness and our proposed mitigation approaches.

[[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_19)
- We propose the principle of identity in knowledge graph completion (KGC).
- We introduce a bilinear KGC method that explicitly models the law of identity and outperforms classical approaches such as RESCAL and ComplEx.
- We provide a theoretical derivation for modeling the law of identity.
